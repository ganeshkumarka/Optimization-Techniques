function solveTransportationProblem(supply, demand, costs):
    // Initialize variables
    initialize transportation plan as a matrix of zeros with dimensions (len(supply), len(demand))
    initialize remaining supply array as a copy of the supply array
    initialize remaining demand array as a copy of the demand array
    
    // Step 1: Calculate initial feasible solution
    while there are still unfulfilled supply or demand:
        find the cell with the minimum transportation cost among the unfilled cells
        determine the amount to be transported from this cell based on remaining supply and demand
        update the transportation plan matrix with this amount
        update the remaining supply and demand arrays accordingly
    
    // Step 2: Improve the solution using optimization methods (if desired)
    // For example, use the stepping stone method or the modified distribution method
    
    // Step 3: Return the optimal transportation plan
    return transportation plan
